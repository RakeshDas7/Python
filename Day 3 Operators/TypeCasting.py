a = 25 #integere type
b = "5" #String type
c = int(b) #int type -> This is called type casting
print(a + int(b)) # Output: 30

print(str(a) + b) # Output: 255

# The conversion of one data type to another data type is know as TypeCasting
# TypeCasting is used to convert the data type of a variable from one data type to another

#Implicit Typecasting
a = 6.8
b = 5
print( a + b) # Output: 11.8

#Implicit Typecasting -> Lower data type to higher data type conversion automatically done by the python
